# DiaLang.Runtime
A dialogue language runtime.

## Using the Runtime
Once you have a compiled project (see [here](https://github.com/dialogue-lang/compiler) for instructions), call `Project.Load(string)` with a path to the DiaLang binary. After that, you can do whatever you want!

Please note <ins>**this is NOT a dialogue system out of the box!**</ins>
This is purely base for which you and your writers can quickly write dialogue and access its data in-engine.

## How can I turn this into a dialogue system?
Don't worry! There are plenty of tutorials out there for generic dialogue systems. There is also a Unity tutorial in the works, expect to see that soon.
